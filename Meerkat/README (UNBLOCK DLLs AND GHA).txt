Dear Meerkat User,

Remember to unblock the dlls and gha before using.
Thanks for downloading the latest version of Meerkat!

Version 6.1 -
Has removed the embedded Google API key.
It now requires adding a file named "google_api_key_mkgis.txt" to your "Libraries" folder, alongside the other 3rd-party GHAs.

First, you'll need to get either a google api key that is not restricted to specific APIs. Or you'll need to create a key that 
allows access to both the "Maps Javascript API" and "Geocoding API".

See: 
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key 
and 
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key

Please add your API key to the otherwise empty file ("google_api_key_mkgis.txt") and save... Meerkat should now run.
